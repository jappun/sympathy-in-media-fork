  "Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is investigating a shooting Saturday at the OPP detachment in Morrisburg, Ont. (Angelina Ouimet)",
  "An eastern Ontario family is demanding answers after a 43-year-old man died Saturday following a shooting at the Ontario Provincial Police detachment in Morrisburg, Ont.",
  "Babak Saidi, who had schizophrenia, was required to check in weekly at the detachment after his 2014 conviction for assault and battery, his sister Elly Saidi told CBC News Saturday evening. \u00a0",
  "He had been visiting the detachment without any incident, she said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 until this weekend, when his check-in went horribly wrong.",
  "\"My brother, he was the kindest, sweetest, most loving person,\" Elly Saidi\u00a0said. \"He had a mental\u00a0disability, and we need to know how to deal with a person with mental disability.\"",
  "Ontario's police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit, invoked its mandate following the fatal shooting Saturday afternoon.",
  "Two shots",
  "Babak\u00a0Saidi departed for his Saturday morning rendezvous at the detachment\u00a0with a tin full of freshly baked muffins.",
  "Babak Saidi, 43, was shot to death at the Morrisburg, Ont., OPP detachment on Saturday, Dec. 23, 2017. The province's police watchdog has invoked its mandate and is investigating the shooting. (Submitted by Elly Saidi)",
  "The muffins were a Christmas gift for his father and a family friend who were picking\u00a0him up\u00a0from his farm near Cardinal, Ont., and bringing him into town.",
  "They were also a\u00a0sign, his sister said, that he was in a good mood.",
  "Recounting her father's version of events, Elly Saidi said when they arrived at the police station, they\u00a0were told to wait about 15 minutes. They went to do some grocery shopping, and when they came back, Babak Saidi got out of the car to go inside.",
  "The next thing her father saw, she said,\u00a0was her brother on the ground, with two officers on top of him.\u00a0",

  "'Sorry, your son\u00a0is gone'",
  "A police officer told her father and his friend to go wait at a nearby Tim Hortons, Elly Saidi said, and that someone would come by to explain what happened.",
  "\"They waited for a few hours, and then the police came,\" she said. \"My dad asked the police, 'Where is my son?' And the police officer told my dad that, sorry, your son is gone.\"",
  "Ten hours after the shooting, Elly Saidi said, that remained the only detail the family had been given\u00a0about what happened inside the detachment \u2014 an absence of information that was \"unacceptable.\"",
  "\"I have to be strong for my parents. It's very hard to see my mom and my dad crying and being heartbroken,\" she said.",
  "\"My mom was sitting in a corner of the room, hugging my brother's picture. And all she's saying is, 'I don't know what happened. I don't know where his body is.'\"",
  "Trying to rebuild life",
  "",
  "Elly Saidi said her brother had been trying to rebuild his life at the time of his death,\u00a0raising sheep and cattle on his\u00a0farm just west of Morrisburg.",
  "A worker with homeless youth in Ottawa, Saidi said she was speaking out because there had been too many recent incidents where interactions between police officers and people with mental health issues had turned violent \u2014 even deadly.",
  "She also said she was certain her brother was unarmed.",
  "\"They have absolutely no tools and no awareness to deal with people with mental disability. Too many people with mental disabilities have died at the hands of the police,\" she said.",
  "\"They need to have education and awareness [of] how to deal with people with mental disability.\u00a0And not [assume] they're all bad and a menace to society.\"",
