  "\u201cHaving reason to contact Tyron as a suspect of an assault I decided to detain him,\u201d the officer\u2019s report states. \u201cI quickly exited my vehicle to take hold of Tyron\u2019s left arm, and he immediately engaged in active aggression by swinging punches at my head, beginning with his left arm.\u201d",
