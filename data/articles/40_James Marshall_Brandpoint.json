  "Carmel Police Chief Paul Tomasi, Sgt. Gerald Maldonado and Officer Rene Guevara saw Marshall outside Marshall's residence about 10:07 a.m., prosecutors said.",
  "When Marshall faced toward the sidewalk, Maldonado fired bean bag rounds to subdue him, prosecutors said.",
  "\"This had no effect, although later the BB rifle was found at this location,\" prosecutors said.",
  "The officers chased Marshall into his backyard where he was hit with additional bean bag rounds.",
