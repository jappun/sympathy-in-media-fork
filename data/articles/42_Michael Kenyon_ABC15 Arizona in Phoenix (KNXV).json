  "Man suffers third-degree burns while being held on hot pavement by Phoenix police",
  "WARNING: This report contains graphic images. Viewer discretion is advised.",
  "As Phoenix police deal with the fallout of the violent beating of a deaf man and face the threat of federal oversight, the department is now set to face a lawsuit after a man suffered third-degree burns across much of his body during a detainment.",
  "Michael Kenyon, who has not been charged with a crime for the incident, spent more than a month hospitalized with burns on his face, arms, chest, and legs.",
  "Some chunks of flesh are now missing from above his knees.",
  "\u201cPhoenix police are demonstrating an utter disregard for human life over and over again,\u201d said Bobby DiCello, one of Kenyon\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThis young man was burned to the third degree because his skin was cooked on asphalt.\u201d",
  "When asked again if he believed officers \u201ccooked\u201d Kenyon, DiCello said, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt.\u201d",
  "Phoenix police said Kenyon struggled with their officers and added that the incident is still the subject of a criminal and internal investigation.",
  "The incident happened on the afternoon of July 6, 2024, when the temperature reached 114\u00ba in central Phoenix.",
  "See surveillance video of the incident in the player below.",
  "Surveillance video shows Kenyon was stopped by officers and questioned in a parking lot near 7th and McKinley streets. After both sides began pulling against each other, a handful of officers took Kenyon down to the blacktop and kept him there for more than four minutes.",
  "A witness from a nearby balcony began recording in the middle of the incident.",
  "The cell phone video shows Kenyon yelling out, \u201cplease\u2026 please\u2026 I can\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
  "See the cell phone video provided to ABC15 in the player below.",
  "\u201cThe lady across in the high-rise said she thought an animal was dying. That\u2019s why she looked out her window,\u201d Kenyon said during an interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when she started recording me.\u201d",
  "Kenyon and his attorneys provided ABC15 with the surveillance and cell phone videos, but they have not been able to obtain a copy of the incident report from Phoenix police.",
  "Through a public records request, ABC15 also requested the incident report and any body camera footage to hear what happened during the incident.",
  "At the time of reporting, those requests have not been completed.",
  "In an interview with ABC15, Kenyon said he believes officers stopped him because his roommate had recently reported a theft from their home, which is across the street. Police later determined Kenyon was not the suspect in the theft.",
  "Below is Kenyon\u2019s account of the initial interaction.",
  "\u201cSo, I walked up to them with my phone in my hand and said, \u2018Hey what happened?\u2019 or \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u2026 One officer grabbed my one wrist, and the other officer grabbed my other wrist\u2026 They said to me in a mean hostile way, \u2018You\u2019re being detained.\u2019 But I said, \u2018I\u2019m on the phone. What do you mean? I didn\u2019t do anything. Please explain to me.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Why are you getting antsy? Why do you seem like you\u2019re nervous?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m not. You\u2019re scaring me. Can you please explain to me? Let me sit down. Let me sit down.\u2019 I sat down on the back of some random person's truck tailgate.\u201d",
  "Kenyon also described his version of what was happening as he was taken down to the ground.",
  "\u201cThey said, \u2018Give me your arms. Stop resisting.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s when like five people were on me\u2026 And I\u2019m just screaming for help. And I\u2019m scared. And I\u2019m thinking this is literally [how] George Floyd was literally like\u2026 And that\u2019s when I\u2019m like this is it, this is me, this is where I guess I\u2019m going to stay at\u2026 This is the end.\u201d",
  "Kenyon said he thought of George Floyd because officers were kneeling on his head, neck, and back.",
  "Video does appear to show an officer kneeling on his head or neck during the incident.",
  "Kenyon said the pain was unbearable.",
  "\u201cLike going through hell and hades\u2026 Feels like your skin is melting off,\u201d he said.",
  "\u201cDeep down I think to myself, I\u2019ve had a bad past, I don\u2019t deserve a lot of good things in my life. So, I\u2019m like maybe I did deserve this, you know,\u201d he said.",
  "Kenyon added that he wouldn\u2019t wish the pain on his worst enemy.",
  "\u201cNo, no I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
  "At the time of the incident, Kenyon had an outstanding warrant for failing to appear on a drug charge, court records show. He claims he didn\u2019t know about the warrant, and the department confirmed officers didn't know either at the time.",
  "Medical records show Kenyon spent several weeks in the burn unit at Valleywise Medical Center and then more time in a rehabilitation facility.",
  "He and his attorneys told ABC15 that officers were stationed at the hospital for several days, possibly a week, and often kept him handcuffed.",
  "\u201cThey were just outside the room,\u201d Kenyon said. \u201cThey had this little clicker thing with the blinds [where they would look through].\u201d",
  "ABC15 is committed to finding the answers you need and holding those accountable.",
  "Submit your news tip to Investigators@abc15.com",
  "He added, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me use my phone and contact my family\u2026 It took certain cops to break the rules to let me use my phone.\u201d",
  "Kenyon said the officers finally left after a friend called some lawyers and they showed up at the hospital.",
  "\u201cHe committed no crime, he\u2019s never been charged with a crime,\u201d DiCello said. \u201cAnd he spent over a month in a burn unit with police peeping through the windows to see what he was doing.\u201d",
  "Kenyon is now represented by a team of local and national law firms.",
  "The attorneys, including DiCello and Steve Benedetto, also represent dozens of protesters who were falsely charged by Phoenix police \u2013 some as members of a fake gang invented by officers and prosecutors.",
  "Those lawyers said Kenyon\u2019s case continues to prove that Phoenix is incapable of policing itself, especially since the incident happened after the Department of Justice released the findings into the city.",
  "The exposure of Kenyon\u2019s incident also comes weeks after Phoenix police faced backlash for the violent arrest of Tyron McAlpin.",
  "The Phoenix Police Department released the following statement to the media regarding this incident:",
  "\"On July 6, 2024, Phoenix police officers responded to the area of 7th Street and McKinley Street regarding a theft in progress. When responding, officers observed an adult male, later identified as Michael Kenyon, who matched the suspect description given for the suspect of the theft.",
  "Officers made contact with Kenyon, telling him he was being detained so they could understand what may have occurred. The man struggled with police, which result with him being taken to the ground on the hot asphalt. The man sustained burns to different parts of his body from the time he was on the ground.",
  "Kenyon was determined not to be the suspect of the theft. He was taken to the hospital and officers learned he had a felony warrant out for his arrest. This incident is the subject on an on-going criminal investigation. An investigation is also being conducted by the Professional Standards Bureau, which began July 9, 2024.\"",
  "UPDATE: After ABC15 reached out to Phoenix police for comment on the burn case, the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office filed criminal charges against Michael Kenyon for a separate incident.",
  "A direct complaint was filed in Maricopa County Superior Court on October 28 at 3:17 p.m.",
  "ABC15 reached out to Phoenix police for comment on Kenyon\u2019s burn case hours earlier \u2013 at 6 a.m. the same day.",
  "\u201cWe\u2019re still investigating this allegation,\u201d said Stephen Benedetto, one of Kenyon\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThe timing of the charges is certainly suspicious, particularly given Phoenix PD\u2019s history. But we\u2019re reserving judgement until we complete our own investigation.\u201d",
  "The new charges are related to an alleged domestic violence incident from March, involving Kenyon and his brother.",
  "The direct complaint, which did not include specific details of the incident, included charges of Aggravated Assault, Assault, and Disorderly Conduct.",
  "In an email to ABC15, the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office responded to the timing of the new charges.",
  "\u201cThe incident involved in this case came to MCAO\u2019s attention in March 2024. More specifically, the submittal was processed on March 21, 2024. The prosecutor who is currently assigned to the case received it on October 2, 2024. There was no conversation yesterday between MCAO and PPD regarding this matter,\u201d according to a spokesperson.",
